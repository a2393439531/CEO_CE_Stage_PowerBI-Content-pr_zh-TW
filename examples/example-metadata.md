# Example - Metadata Properties #

This document is a demonstration of property settings that all the documents must have in order to be published.  

---
## Metadata Properties ##

The metadata properties should be placed at the beginning of the source Markdown document. There are both required/mandatory and optional properties. If the metadata is required, then the documentation publishing service will generate an error when validating the content and block publishing until the metadata has been fixed.  If the metadata is not required then a warning will be generated by the publishing service.


They should follow this syntax:

`<properties pageTitle="page-title" description="description" services="services" documentationCenter="documentation-center"  authors="authors" tags="tag1,tag2" />`

The following table shows more information for each property setting:

|--------|--------|--------|
| pageTitle       | 是       | Page title used in the HTML/Head/Title.  Note that this could be different than the document title. |
